# Program to perform addition and subtraction of two numbers

# Taking input from the user
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

# Performing addition and subtraction
sum_result = num1 + num2
diff_result = num1 - num2

# Displaying the results
print("\nResults:")
print(f"Addition: {num1} + {num2} = {sum_result}")
print(f"Subtraction: {num1} - {num2} = {diff_result}")
